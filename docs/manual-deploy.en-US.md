# Cloudflare Manual Deployment Guide

If you are comfortable with Cloudflare and the command line, or prefer customized control over the deployment process, follow this guide for manual deployment and future updates.

> 💡 **Tip**: If you are deploying using an AI assistant (such as Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, Cursor, or Trae), the agent should follow the [AI Agent Cloudflare Deployment](agent-deploy-cloudflare.md) runbook.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Fork the official repository**:
   Visit and fork the official repository: [https://github.com/tianma-if/edgeever](https://github.com/tianma-if/edgeever)

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```sh
   git clone <your fork repository URL>
   cd edgeever
   ```

3. **Deploy with the automated helper commands**:
   ```sh
   # Copy the configuration template
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   
   # Install dependencies
   bun install
   
   # Initialize deployment resources and set the first login password
   EDGE_EVER_PASSWORD='<your password>' bun run deploy:setup
   
   # Check the deployment environment and configurations
   bun run deploy:doctor
   
   # Deploy to Cloudflare
   bun run deploy
   ```

### Creating Cloudflare Resources Manually

If you prefer not to use the automated `deploy:setup` helper, you can create the resources manually using Cloudflare CLI (Wrangler):

```sh
# Copy configuration template and install dependencies
cp .env.local.example .env.local
bun install

# Create the D1 database
bunx wrangler d1 create edgeever

# Create the R2 bucket
bunx wrangler r2 bucket create edgeever-resources

# Generate the password hash
bun run auth:hash -- <your password>

# Deploy
bun run deploy
```

After creation, copy the D1 `database_id` and the generated password hash into your local `.env.local` file.

## Updating to the Latest Version

When a new version is released, you can sync your fork and redeploy to apply updates:

1. Open your EdgeEver fork on GitHub.
2. Click **Sync fork** to pull the latest official code into your fork.
3. Pull the updates locally and redeploy:
   ```sh
   git pull
   bun install
   bun run deploy:doctor
   bun run deploy
   ```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Syncing the fork on GitHub only updates your repository code. It does not redeploy your Cloudflare instance. You must redeploy locally (or via an Agent) for the updates to take effect.
